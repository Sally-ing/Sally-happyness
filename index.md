Finally, there is a poem she likes:

#### High Mountains and Long Roads

Shouting is bursting-out silence.
And silence is a soundless call.
Whether passion or quietness,
I only hope
It is not boring.

If a distant place shouts to me,
I will walk towards it.
If a high mountain calls me,
I will walk towards it.
My feet might be grazed;
Let the setting sun paint the way.
My hands might be scratched;
Let the azaleas replace the brambles.
No roads are longer than the feet;
No mountains are higher than human beings
